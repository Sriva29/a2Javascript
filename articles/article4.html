        <p>Whether you‚Äôre growing one for Movember or simply because they‚Äôre on trend at the moment (the moustache is
            the new beard, don‚Äôt you know?) a ‚Äòtache takes time to train and needs some TLC if it‚Äôs to look its best.

            And who better to give some advice on mustache care and maintenance than ten guys who either have one or
            look after ‚Äòtaches for a living (and in some cases both)?</p>

        <h2>1. GET YOUR TIMING RIGHT</h2>
        <p>‚ÄúThe easiest way to trim your moustache in the initial stages is with clippers or a beard trimmer, but after
            three to four weeks graduate from these to a quality pair of facial hair scissors to trim around the mouth.
            This is also the time to start using a moustache comb, along with a little wax. These will help shape your
            moustache but will also even it out, helping fill any gaps and prevent it from looking fluffy.‚Äù

            Michael Beardsley, stylist at Pall Mall Barbers in London and owner of a beautifully maintained moustache.
