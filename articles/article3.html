        <p>If horseshoes are good luck, perhaps the horseshoe mustache facial hair style will bring some good fortune to
            your daily shaving ritual. The horseshoe facial hair style is like a mustache, but includes two long bars of
            mustache hair pointing downwards, often extending all the way to the chin. With the All Purpose Gillette
            STYLER, you can achieve this look.</p>
        <h2>The Horseshoe Mustache Look</h2>
        <p>There are countless facial hair styles, but this doesnâ€™t mean that trimming a mustache will be complicated.
            Hereâ€™s a simple set of steps to get you on your way to the popular horseshoe mustache style:</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-1.webp" alt="styling step 1 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 1: Select a Fixed-Length Comb for Trimming</h2>
        <p>The right comb length on your trimmer can help you style your look. The All Purpose Gillette STYLER comes
            with three comb attachments (2 mm, 4 mm, 6 mm) for you to choose from</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-2.webp" alt="styling step 2 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 2: Trim Your Facial Hair</h2>
        <p>Even out your mustache hair length with the trimmer.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-3.webp" alt="styling step 3 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 3: Define Your Mustache Shape</h2>
        <p>Remove your trimmerâ€™s comb attachment and trim your mustache to define the Horseshoe shape. Trimming hairs
            before shaving can help reduce tug and pull while shaving, and this can help prevent clogged blades.</p>

        <h2>Step 4: Check For Symmetry As You Go</h2>
        <p>But be careful not to trim too much off in an effort to look even.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-5.webp" alt="styling step 5 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 5: Prep Your Face</h2>
        <p>Rinse your face with warm water to help hydrate your hair in preparation for shaving. Then, lather up the parts of your face that you want to shave completely bareâ€”the non-mustache partsâ€”with a shave gel. Using a shave gel can help prevent nicks, cuts, and irritation.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-6.webp" alt="styling step 6 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 6: Shave With Light, Gentle Strokes</h2>
        <p>Attach the razor blade onto your Gillette STYLER handle and shave with light, gentle strokes to give yourself a close shave. Any Fusion5 blade refill fits the STYLER.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-7.webp" alt="styling step 7 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 7: Rinse Your Blades Often</h2>
        <p>Rinsing the blades often throughout your shave helps to prevent buildup of hairs and shaving cream on the blade edges and cartridge; this helps keep your razor performing at its best.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-8.webp" alt="styling step 8 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 8: Edge With the Precision Trimmer</h2>
        <p>On the back of all Fusion5 razors is a precision blade; use this to help define the mustache shape and achieve clean edges.</p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-9.webp" alt="styling step 9 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 9: Rinse, Towel, and Moisturize</h2>
        <p></p>

        <img src="../img/handlebar steps/handlebar-step-10.webp" alt="styling step 10 for handlebar moustache">
        <h2>Step 10: You Have Just Mastered the Horseshoe Mustache Style!</h2>
        <p>With Gillette razors and trimmers, your personal grooming possibilities are endless.</p>
