        <p>Did you know that you could be imprisoned for shaving your moustache? Between 1860 and 1916, every soldier in
            the British Army was forbidden from shaving his upper lip or else it would have been considered a breach of
            discipline.

            According to the Oxford dictionary, it was in 1585 that the word â€˜moustacheâ€™ was first recorded in the
            translation of the French book, The nauigations, peregrinations and voyages, made into Turkie. The moustache
            would need close to another 300 years to become the emblem of the British Empire, the empire which in itsâ€™
            heyday ruled a quarter of the worldâ€™s population.

            During the Napoleonic Wars in the 1800s, British officers were inspired by the coxcombical Frenchmen with
            their whiskers being â€˜appurtenances of terrorâ€™. In the newly colonized lands of India, the moustache was a
            symbol of male prestige. Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore, commemorated his victory over the East India
            Company with a painting depicting the clean-shaven British soldiers as if they looked like girls or at least
            creatures â€˜who are not fully maleâ€™.</p>
