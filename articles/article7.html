        <h2>1800â€“1880s â€“ beards maketh the man</h2>
        <p>Facial hair was big in the 19th century. Look at paintings or photographs from this time, and chances are the
            men will have beards, moustaches or sideburns â€“ and sometimes elaborate combinations of all three.

            For much of the century, the emphasis was on beards and â€™burns. Big hairy beards were all the rage in the
            middle decades. The bushier the beard, the more virile the man, some people believed. In an age as obsessed
            with health issues as our own, some people claimed that good beards meant good health.</p>
